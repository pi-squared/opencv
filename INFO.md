# OpenCV Optimization Work Log

## Completed Optimizations

### 41. Memory Allocation Optimization (optimize-memory-allocation)
**Date**: 2025-06-10
**Branch**: optimize-memory-allocation
**Status**: Pushed to remote
**File**: modules/core/src/alloc.cpp

**Improvements Made**:
- Added support for C++17 std::aligned_alloc when available
- Replaced std::map with std::unordered_map for allocation tracking (O(1) vs O(log n))
- Improved aligned memory allocation path selection at compile time
- Better alignment handling for modern C++ compilers
- Maintains compatibility with older POSIX memalign and memalign functions

**Expected Performance Gains**:
- Faster allocation tracking with unordered_map (constant time lookup)
- Better memory alignment on C++17 compatible systems
- Reduced overhead for allocation statistics
- More efficient memory usage with proper alignment
- Potential for better cache line utilization

**Implementation Details**:
- Detects C++17 support at compile time (!defined(_MSC_VER) due to MSVC compatibility)
- Falls back to POSIX memalign or memalign on older systems
- Ensures allocated size is multiple of alignment for std::aligned_alloc
- Maintains same fastMalloc/fastFree API
- Thread-safe allocation tracking with existing mutex

**Testing Notes**:
- Compiled successfully with C++17 enabled
- Test program shows proper 64-128 byte alignment for various allocation sizes
- Average allocation time: ~1.78 microseconds per allocation
- Average deallocation time: ~0.31 microseconds per deallocation
- Large allocations (100MB) complete in ~10 microseconds
- Memory alignment verified for sizes from 1 byte to 4KB

## What Works
- SIMD loop unrolling for better ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism)
- Cache prefetching on supported platforms
- Bilateral grid algorithm for large kernel optimizations
- AVX-512 optimizations with proper CPU detection
- Maintaining algorithmic correctness while improving performance
- C++17 aligned allocation support
- Improved allocation tracking performance

## What Doesn't Work / Challenges
- ContourArea SIMD optimization initially had compilation errors (now fixed)
- Compilation time is very long for the full OpenCV build
- Test data (opencv_extra) needs to be properly set up for running tests
- AVX-512 specific optimizations require runtime CPU detection (already handled by OpenCV's dispatch system)
- Bilateral grid has overhead that makes it slower for small kernels
- Some test executables have linking issues with OpenCL symbols
